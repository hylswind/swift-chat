## Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock

### Prerequisites

Click [Amazon Bedrock Model access](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess) to enable your models
access.

### Configuration

You can choose one of the following two methods for configuration

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Configure Bedrock API Key (Click to expand)</b></summary>

1. Click [Amazon Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) to create a
   long-term API
   key.

2. Copy and paste the API key to the (Amazon Bedrock -> Bedrock API Key) under SwiftChat Settings page.

3. The App will automatically get the latest model list based on the region you currently selected. If multiple models
   appear in the list, it means the configuration is successful.

<summary><b>🔧 Configure SwiftChat Server (Click to expand)</b></summary>

### Architecture

![](/assets/architecture.avif)

By default, we use **AWS App Runner**, which is commonly used to host Python FastAPI servers, offering high performance,
scalability and low latency.

Alternatively, we provide the option to replace App Runner with **AWS Lambda** using Function URL for a more
cost-effective
solution, as shown in
this [example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter/tree/main/examples/fastapi-response-streaming).

### Step 1: Set up your API Key

1. Sign in to your AWS console and
   right-click [Parameter Store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/) to open it in a new tab.
2. Check whether you are in the [supported region](#supported-region), then click on the **Create parameter** button.
3. Fill in the parameters below, leaving other options as default:

    - **Name**: Enter a parameter name (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey", will be used as `ApiKeyParam` in Step 2).

    - **Type**: Select `SecureString`

    - **Value**: Enter any string without spaces.(this will be your `API Key` in Step 3)

4. Click **Create parameter**.

### Step 2: Deploy stack and get your API URL

1. Click one of the following buttons to launch the CloudFormation Stack in the same region where your API Key was
   created.

    - **App Runner**

      [![Launch Stack](assets/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatAPI&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatAppRunner.template)

    - **Lambda** (Note: For AWS customer use only)

      [![Launch Stack](assets/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatLambda&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatLambda.template)

2. Click **Next**, On the "Specify stack details" page, provide the following information:
    - Fill the `ApiKeyParam` with the parameter name you used for storing the API key (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey").
    - For App Runner, choose an `InstanceTypeParam` based on your needs.
3. Click **Next**, Keep the "Configure stack options" page as default, Read the Capabilities and Check the "I
   acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources" checkbox at the bottom.
4. Click **Next**, In the "Review and create" Review your configuration and click **Submit**.

Wait about 3-5 minutes for the deployment to finish, then click the CloudFormation stack and go to **Outputs** tab, you
can find the **API URL** which looks like: `https://xxx.xxx.awsapprunner.com` or `https://xxx.lambda-url.xxx.on.aws`

### Step 3: Open the App and setup with API URL and API Key

1. Launch the App, open the drawer menu, and tap **Settings**.
2. Paste the `API URL` and `API Key`(The **Value** you typed in Parameter Store) Under Amazon Bedrock -> SwiftChat
   Server, then select your Region.
3. Click the top right ✓ icon to save your configuration and start your chat.

Congratulations 🎉 Your SwiftChat App is ready to use!
